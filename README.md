## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* npm, yarn, or pnpm
* Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/desto4q/anira.git
cd anira
```

Install dependencies (using npm or pnpm):

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Running Locally (Development)

Start the dev server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

To build the application:

```bash
npm run build
# or
pnpm build
```

This produces a production-ready build in `build/`, containing:

* `client/` — static assets
* `server/` — server-side code for SSR

You can then serve or deploy the build output.

---

## Docker Deployment

You can containerize Anira using the included `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t anira-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 anira-app
```

Once running, the application will listen on port 3000 inside the container.

This containerized setup can be deployed to platforms such as:

* AWS ECS
* Google Cloud Run
* Azure Container Apps
* DigitalOcean App Platform
* Railway
* Fly.io ([GitHub][1])

## Project Structure

```
anira/
├── app/                     # Application (server / SSR) code
├── public/                  # Static assets
├── .dockerignore
├── Dockerfile
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── react-router.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

* `app/` — contains server-side and shared logic, data loaders, route handlers
* `public/` — publicly accessible static files
* `react-router.config.ts` — route definitions, data fetching setup
* `vite.config.ts` — build & tooling configuration
* TypeScript config in `tsconfig.json`

---

## Configuration & Environment Variables

You may need environment variables for:

* API base URL (where to fetch anime data)
* Secrets / API keys (if applicable)
* Port / host for server

For example, you might have a `.env` file:

```env
API_BASE_URL=https://api.youranimebackend.com
PORT=3000
```

Make sure to update `vite.config.ts`, server bootstrap code, or `react-router.config.ts` to read and use these variables appropriately.

If you like, I can generate a more detailed README (with API details, environment variable templates, deployment scripts, etc.) after I inspect the code more deeply. Would you like me to expand it?
